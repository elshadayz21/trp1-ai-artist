From the highlands we rise, voices strong and free,
Rivers weave their stories, flowing to the sea.
Golden light through valleys, hope begins to grow,
Unity and courage, in every heart we know.

Mountains sing of history, skies of endless blue,
Fields of green remind us, tomorrow starts anew.
Drums of joy are beating, calling us to stand,
Together we are stronger, hand in hand in hand.

Through the storms we’ve weathered, still our spirit shines,
Songs of love and freedom echo through the pines.
Ethiopia, our homeland, bright with dreams untold,
A future built with kindness, more precious than gold.

Rise and sing together, let the world rejoice,
Harmony and vision carried in our voice.
From the highlands upward, let our anthem soar,
Hope and unity forever, shining evermore.
